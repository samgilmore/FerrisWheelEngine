# Ferris Wheel Engine

A simple interactive Ferris Wheel simulation built with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. This project showcases a rotating Ferris wheel with moving cabins, clouds, and swaying grassâ€”all drawn dynamically with smooth animations.

## Key Features

- **Rotating Ferris Wheel**: The Ferris wheel rotates smoothly, with eight evenly spaced cabins swaying slightly as they spin.
  
- **Custom Cabin Design**: Each cabin is composed of a simple triangle and semicircle. The cabins remain upright as the wheel rotates.

- **Moving Clouds**: Clouds move across the sky at different speeds, respawning when they leave the screen to create a continuous floating effect.

- **Swaying Grass**: Grass blades at the bottom of the canvas gently sway, with random height variations for natural movement.

- **Smiley Face Center**: A playful smiley face is drawn at the center of the Ferris wheel, adding character to the design.
